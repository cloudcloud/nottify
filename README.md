#nottify
Nottify is a self-managed replacement for Spotify. For those with many media files, and multiple devices, each without mass storage capabilities, this provides a way to stream on demand.

##requirements

##usage
Initial usage requires processing of base content, after setting up configuration requirements. This
initial process will also run-through base configuration set, and instantiation of the database. Of
course, all configuration can be modified at a later date.
